# lumicore :: DevTools

DevTools aids with development. at the time there is an I18N interface for editing and (AI) translating GUI Labels.

Also there is a diagram tool (UML, ERD) but that is still a work in progress... the diagram tool should at some point in time be able to generate code, primarily the database model classes.

it is sometimes required to refresh the IDEs directories for changes made in DevTools to take effect.
